finalized. followed some ideas from the "30 Days of jQuery" course at Tuts+ to make my own test blog post. Got some help on StackExchange (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26546024/finding-either-a-or-b-class-within-a-loop-then-executing-similar-code/26546113#26546113) on putting the code into a function versus having two large functions. You can see the original here (http://jsfiddle.net/wc6ny2xn/).

#### todo:
- [x] implement
- [x] simplify code
- [x] play with css
