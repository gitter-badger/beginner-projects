last updated: 18.10.2014
version: 0.1
i am currently working on this, i have the functionality i want at the most basic level. i am looking into tweaking it next.

#### todo:
- [X] get version 0.1 going, basic functionality.
- [ ] load the quotes after 5 seconds.
- [ ] add a fade to that.
- [ ] update the stylesheet.css file so it's not so butt ugly.
